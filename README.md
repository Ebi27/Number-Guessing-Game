# Number-Guessing-Game
I started by creating the structure of the age by implementing the html of the index.html. 
I then created the index.JS and styles.css files. I created the container which has all the informations and displays of the game, styles it in the CSS file and created the 
functions which at the moment does not work even after trying to link it again to the index.html file.
